So we can add these files to github, certain settings files have
had their full hostnames removed, leaving just a part in the file. 

These hostnames must be edited in order for the app to work. 

All hostnames used in the working app are in the form of:
vmname.sfu.cloud.suffix

4 parts to the hostname, with three dots in between.
_Not_ numeric.

Files with these place holders:
islandviewer-ui/Islandviewer/settings/uploader.py (ISLANDVIEWER_HOST field)
islandviewer-ui/Islandviewer/settings/databases.py (HOST field)
